# 👋🏻 Hello, I'm Pat!

I'm a product/program manager with a deep love for computer programming. My journey began back in the mid-90's when I discovered a dusty old computer with QBasic in my parent's garage. Since then, I've been hooked. Here, you'll find a mix of personal projects, experiments, and musings that reflect my curiosity about all things tech.

## 🌟 About Me

By day, I'm fully immersed in fintech, helping bridge the gap between old and new systems. I'm passionate about computer science, programming languages, computer history, and leveraging AI workflows to build better applications.

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

- **📱 iOS Development**: SwiftUI and app development adventures, focusing on clean design, privacy, and a seamless user experience.
- **💻 Programming Fun**: Python scripts, AI experiments, and other coding explorations.
- **📊 Data & Analytics**: Projects that merge my finance background with tech, showcasing my analytical skills and love for numbers.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm always looking to expand my skill set. Recently, I've been diving into:
